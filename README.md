# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Reinforcement Learning
A simple and educational implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using reinforcement learning. This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to game environments, enabling an AI to learn and play against a human in a classic board game setting.

# Overview
This project implements Tic-Tac-Toe with both human and computer players. The computer player learns optimal strategies via reinforcement learning, exploring the game state space and improving performance over time. The code is modular, with clear classes and functions to maintain a robust and error-free environment.

# Features
Play Tic-Tac-Toe against a computer agent trained with reinforcement learning

Includes support for human vs. human and human vs. computer matches

Clean, class-based code design for maintainability

Error handling ensures efficient, bug-free operation
